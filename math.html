<h1>Math IA</h1>
<p>This is my Math IA written for IB. Completed winter 2020.</p>
<h2>The Hadshake Problem and Variations Thereof</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This IA is meant to give information regarding the handshake problem and to find ways to reliably solve it. This is accomplished primarily using equations, but diagrams are used too. These diagrams are meant to be a way to visualize the problem and to give reliable checks on the equations.</p>
<p>The aim of this paper is to give a resource to teachers, as the handshake problem is a common math problem given to students (NZMaths). The equations can be used to check student work or as teaching material in and of itself. The standard equation, highlighted in the standard variation method section, is corroborated by my sources (see works cited).</p> 
<p>Some definitions: Variation - Given to the two other problems that are based off the main handshake problem. N - meaning the number of people in a given scenario. H - the number of handshakes performed, only one interaction between a pair of people is counted. P - the number of people in a party, all parties must have the same number of people. Model  - a graphic representation, specifically of the handshake problem.</p>
