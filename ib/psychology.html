<h2>Priming and Its Effect on Human Behavior </h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p> The role that words play in our everyday lives is something that is inarguably important. If successful priming can occur with as little trigger as reading words that we associate with old, then the role of words can be more important in peoples’ lives than we would assume. And if there is any effect on our behavior then research in this field is relevant. <p>
<p>	The psychological theory that the experiment is based on is priming, described as “the incidental activation of knowledge structures, such as trait concepts and stereotypes, by the current situational context.”(Bargh et al), which in theory will affect the behavior of participants. The original study, where this definition is pulled from, was looking at how participants were affected by various types of priming, including the elderly priming used in this project. The experiment was the same as ours, where two groups were subjected to priming through a task, and their walking speeds were recorded. <p>
	<p>The Bargh et al (1996) study looked at the effect of priming on the walking speed. This was done by having participants complete a word puzzle that contained words that had connotations with age and elderliness (with a control with non connotated words.). The study found that there was an effect on the walking speed of participants when primed (Bargh et al).<p>   
<p>This investigation was meant to see how the effect of priming, in this case priming agedness, affected the walking speeds of participants. The age priming was the independent variable which affected the walking speeds of participants which is the recorded independent variable. Having no priming was the control. The target population is high school students 16 to 18 years of age. The hypothesis of this study is that when participants are subjected to the priming stimuli they will have a slower walking speed in seconds compared to participants who were given the control task. The theoretical prediction of the study is to find that priming has an effect on behavior, specifically the behavior of walking.<p> 
<p>The null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the walking speeds of the control group and the primed group.<p>
