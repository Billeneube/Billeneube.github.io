<h3>RQ: What problems in Soviet planning and organization contributed to the early failure of the Soviet invasion of Finland during the Russo-Finish war of 1939?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The aim of this paper is to answer the question, ‘What problems in Soviet planning and organization contributed to the early failure of the Soviet invasion of Finland during the Russo-Finish war?’ This is accomplished using varied sources, namely the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact (1939), and Julia Abelev, “Perceptual Realism and the Winter War of 1939” (2009). These viewpoints offer valuable evaluations of the events in and surrounding the Winter War. They are very useful to give information and context to the Russo-Finish war, and to lend insight on the above question.</p>
	The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (1939) has an origin as a non aggression pact between Joachim von Ribbentrop of Nazi Germany and Vyacheslav Molotov of the USSR. The pact’s purpose was to stop any future fighting with these two states, and to divide up eastern Europe between them. In a secret section of the document the Baltic states (Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) were given to the USSR. This forms the Russian claim of Finland that eventually led to the invasion of Finland in the winter of 1939. </p>
This document is valuable as it gives context as to why Russia decided to invade Finland. With Nazi Germany at their doorstep, the USSR wanted to have more defense, and occupying Finland allowed them to gain this. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact also shows the relationship between the Russians and the Germans, which becomes important when looking at the Russian adoption of the Nazi’s Blitzkrieg tactic.</p> 
There are some limitations of this document, mainly the nature of the document. It was written by two foreign ministers who belonged to two controlling nations. Some of the agreements that had been included in this document were later violated.</p>
The reliability of Molotov and Ribbentrop are questionable, mainly that Finland would be in Russia’s power, that the Baltic states were to be under Russia's control, and the pact for non-aggression, these parts of the pact were broken.</p>
“Perceptual Realism and the Winter War of 1939” is a 2009 article written by Julia Abelev. The purpose of this article is to analyze the actions of leaders of the USSR during the Winter War in the scope of Perceptual Realism. The source investigates the Winter War on the Russian side, detailing their plans, organization, and actions. Then it takes these facts and looks at them and explains them using Perceptual Realism, the idea that the world is how the viewer sees it, being objective and not taking into account subjectivity. Essentially it evaluates how Soviet high command severely overestimated their preparedness in the war.</p> 
A limitation of this source is its focus, which isn’t entirely on history. It  is partially a psychology/philosophy paper, which takes some attention away from history, changing the focus from being purely historical. Another limitation is in its origin. The article was written in 2009, seventy years after the war had started, so there are some limits in its historical accuracy, as it was not written when the war was taking place. </p>
This source is valuable because it discusses the decisions and planning of the USSR, and details their problems. This source’s information of precise facts gives very useful quotations that back up information that is given in this paper. It uses sources that include quotes from Soviet leaders and sources that give precise numbers and statistics of the war. Overall it is a very useful source that gives lots of information about the Soviet side of the Winter War. </p>
